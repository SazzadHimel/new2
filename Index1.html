    <h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m Sazzad and a student in the CSE department at BRAC University. There is nothing much to say about me. This is my 4th semester and I’m doing Rs semester on BRAC University residential campus. If I talk about Tarc it is one of the best experiences of my life because I have got some nice friends and talking with them, studying together, and playing many different types of games gives me pleasure. There is some academic pressure but I can handle those somehow. If I talk about faculties and other members of TARC, they are well behaved and always try to help us in many situations. To end talking about myself, I’m my TARC life as well as missing my family.
